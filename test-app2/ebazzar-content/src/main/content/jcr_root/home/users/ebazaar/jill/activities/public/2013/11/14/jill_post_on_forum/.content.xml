It's also a fun way to look back at the heritage of footwear still on the market today. For example: The Nike Air Pegasus just celebrated its 30th anniversary this year, and a 20th edition of the Asics Gel-Kayano is just around the corner. However, those shoes are quite a bit different from their beginnings. Here's a look at a few highlights from the '70s, '80s, and '90s."
